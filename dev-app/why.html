    <p>
        Every application needs a consistent UI, so does yours. There are several alternatives out there for your Aurelia application. The great about Office UI Fabric is that is what Microsoft use for Office 365, Visual Studio Online and basically all their online prescence.
        That means that is does not matter if you are building add-ins for Office 365 or your next great award winning public application, Office UI Fabric gives you a consistent look and feel.
    </p>
    <p>
        The problem is that Office UI is built with React. This npm package wraps many of the React components and expose them as easy to use Aurelia components.
